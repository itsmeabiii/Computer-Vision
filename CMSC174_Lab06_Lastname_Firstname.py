# This laboratory exercise should be done in groups of 2 students.

# Tasks
# 1. Study the following resources
	# a) HO Chapter 8
	# b) https://learnopencv.com/object-tracking-using-opencv-cpp-python/
	# c) https://broutonlab.com/blog/opencv-object-tracking
	
# 2. Implement a basic motion detector with the provided video as input, and using the following background subtractors:
	# a) MOG2
	# b) KNN 
	# c) GMG
	# d) CNT
	# e) GSOC
	# f) LSBP 

# 3. Track the second hand of the clock in the provided video,  using the following trackers.
	# a) MeanShift
	# b) CamShift
	# c) MeanShift with Kalman filter
	# d) Boosting
	# e) MIL
	# f) KCF
	# g) TLD
	# h) MedianFlow
	# i) GOTURN
	# j) MOSSE
	# k) CSRT

# 4. Make a report comparing and analyzing the results of different background subtractors and trackers.
	# Some things to consider:
	# a) The movement of the second hand is not in a continuous manner.
	# b) There are times that the second hand coincides with the hour or minute hand.
	# c) Although not obvious, the minute and hour hands are also moving through time.

# Deadline of submission: May 5, 2023
